# How to contribute:
As of now, this is a just-started project. I personally try to review all code so please contribute the normal way by:
1. Forking the project
2. Writing your code
3. Checking your code (e.g. ensure a normal editor/IDE does not give much warnings and such and ensure that it works on your platform/Firefox)
4. Making a Pull Request to the Master branch
5. Waiting for my review
6. Maybe make some changes based on the review

And that's all. After the review I'll try to merge it with Master asap.
